A NSS classroom project exploring topics such as data structures, dictionaries, and sorting algorithms.

### Goal

To create a few different classes and understand how a singly-linked list works. Add functionality to add and remove nodes.  Create a dictionary class to add and remove data.  Implement three sorting algorithms to test.

### Tools Used

### Installation

Create new repository and enter the following command:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/threepears/node-science.git
```

Then you can see the console logs by running "node" with the name of the file after, like so:
